## Unit 8 Project: SQL Library Manager

**Summary:** This is a library manager built on express.  It uses the Sequelize ORM to grab book data from a SQLite database and then renders that data using the Pug template engine.

Users can complete all CRUD operations in order to manage the library.  Users are presented with friendly error messages such as when they've improperly filled out a form or when they've accessed a non-existent page.  Furthermore, users are able to search for books by author, title, genre, or year.

Overall, this project has helped me with getting comfortable using back-end technologies.


**How to use**:

1. Download the project files and extract the folder to your computer.
2. Open the terminal/command prompt and change directories to the project directory.
3. Run the command `npm install` to install the project's dependencies.
4. Run the command `npm start` to start the app.    
5. View the project in your browser by going to [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000/)


**Extra Credit**

1. JS: Added search functionality so users can search by title, author, genre, or year.
2. JS: Included pagination functionality so users can page through results.
3. JS: Added 'View Entire Library' button & route in case user wants to view the entire library.
4. CSS: Customized fonts, background, borders, and other minor styles.  Ensured that app is mobile-responsive.
